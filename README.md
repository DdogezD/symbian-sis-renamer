# Symbian SIS Renamer
 Tool for renaming SIS files

 Usage: Just Drag&Drop SIS files you want to rename to left listbox. I don't recommend doing more than 20 files at a time (although it is possible). If "ERROR" shows as new name for some SIS files, don't worry, it won't be renamed - it just means SIS couldn't be parsed for some reason.

 Only depends on .NET Framework v2.0 (no .NET issue on WinXP and Win7 VMs)  
 Created with Visual Studio 2012 Express edition

Special thanks to Marco Bellino for sharing the source code of "SISXplorer", without the sources for it, "SIS Renamer" wouldn't be able to work without binary dependencies
